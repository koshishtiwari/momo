Error and Fix Documentation
1. TypeScript Errors in server Workspace
Issue:

Type Mismatch: The user property in index.ts conflicted with the type declared in @fastify/jwt.
Property Access Error: The role property was accessed on request.user in auth.ts, but its type did not guarantee the presence of role.
Implicit any Types: Parameters in search.ts lacked explicit type annotations.
Fix:

Updated the user property type in index.ts to align with @fastify/jwt.
Added a type guard in auth.ts to ensure request.user is an object before accessing role.
Added explicit type annotations for parameters in search.ts.
2. Dependency Vulnerabilities
Issue:

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in project dependencies, including a high-severity vulnerability in the next package.
Fix:

Ran npm audit fix --force to resolve most vulnerabilities.
Upgraded the next package in the client workspace to the latest version, resolving the high-severity vulnerability.
3. Build Errors
Issue:

The server workspace failed to build due to the TypeScript errors mentioned above.
Fix:

Resolved all TypeScript errors, and the server workspace was successfully rebuilt.
4. Missing .gitignore
Issue:

The project lacked a .gitignore file, leading to unnecessary files being tracked in version control.
Fix:

Created a .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files and folders, such as node_modules, build outputs, .env files, and IDE-specific files.
